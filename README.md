# Code Refactoring of Horiseon Webpage


## Description
Code refactoring is defined as the process of restructuring computer code without changing or adding to its external behavior and functionality. As our first class Challenge we were tasked to **clean** the coding for Horiseon webpage. It was an individual task which made it even more tideous but slowly with studying and a few tutoring questions, it became easier.

It took me about 7 days (1 hour daily), working on my assignment to get this far. I was able to change the coding to make it more semantic, reduce the lines of coding on the css file significantly and maintain functionality of the page.
